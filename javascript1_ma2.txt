//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
- A function literal is also known as an anonymous function, which is a function without an identifier
that is declared at run-time because it is assigned to a variable or passed in as a parameter.

2. What is the constructor?
- There are built-in constructors such as Object and Array, and there is custom-constructors
which define methods and properties for your own type of object. Constructors are useful for creating several 
similar objects with the same properties and methods.

3. What does the return statement do?

- A fuction ends as soon as the return statement is executed, so any code in the function below the return statement will not be executed.

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();
- "inside my fuction" will be written to the console log.

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
- There are different types of scope in JS and it referes to where within your code variables and fuctions are.
Golbal scope is accessable everywhere because a variable is defined outside a function, whereas local scope is only accessable inside the function it was written.
